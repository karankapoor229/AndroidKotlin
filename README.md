**About -**

This is a sample project which I have done to learn Android using Kotlin.

There are two main parts:

	## ImageView in RecyclerView
		In this Activity, JSON data is being fetched using Retrofit to set the RecyclerView Items, the images are fetched and placed using Picasso 

	## Contact Backup
		In this Activity, Contacts are being backed up inside Zip file as a CSV file using OpenCSV, the permission handling is done using EasyPermissions and it supports Android M+ permissions.

**Caution -**

	## As it is a learning project, the code is hacky and I suggest not to take any reference for production code.
